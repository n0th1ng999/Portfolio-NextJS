		"text": "For the last four months of my undergraduate studies, I have completed an internship during which I worked on a novel project at Mog Technologies, an OTT-TV provider. My work concentrated on video chunking HTTP traffic request logs in an effort to find ways to apply Green Streaming.\n\nAs a result, I was able to determine the geographic location of users and the type of connection they were using (whether or not they were capable of streaming in HD), the time of day when users were most active, and the type of device being used.\n\nUsing the insights described above, I created a proposal that would help in reducing storage space required for Video on Demand (VOD) assets by approximately 15%. This would reduce the energy used to provide the content and would have a reduced negative impact on users experience as measured in Quality of Experience (QoE).\n\nAt the end of the internship, I designed a model that predicts the most likely streaming resolution a user would request depending on their geographic location, the time of the request and the device at time they are using, using their traffic data to train the model. The model's accuracy is greater than 80%. This would allow service providers to decrease the quality of streaming dynamically to enhance efficiency.",
