								{`I'm Tiago Pereira, a 22-year-old Junior ML Engineer and Full-Stack Developer from Porto, Portugal. My passion for coding started at 15 with C terminal programs, leading me to pursue a tech-focused education.

I recently earned a degree in TSIW and was fascinated by AI's impact. And I decided during curricular internship to discover how to leverage data to create AI models, aboard Mog Technologies, I investigated data-driven solutions for Green Streaming, merging technology with sustainability. 

I practice Kickboxing and Muay Thai, which sharpen my focus and resilience. I'm also an avid gamer, enjoying the challenge and strategy that keep my mind sharp under pressure. ðŸ¥ŠðŸŽ®`}
